Publicly accessible document image collection with realistic scope and complexity is important to the document image analysis and search community. Tobacco800 is a public subset of the complex document image processing (CDIP) test collection constructed by Illinois Institute of Technology, assembled from 42 million pages of documents (in 7 million multi-page TIFF images) released by tobacco companies under the Master Settlement Agreement and originally hosted at UCSF.

Tobacco800, composed of 1290 document images, is a realistic database for document image analysis research as these documents were collected and scanned using a wide variety of equipment over time. In addition, a significant percentage of Tobacco800 are consecutively numbered multi-page business documents, making it a valuable testbed for various content-based document image retrieval approaches. Resolutions of documents in Tobacco800 vary significantly from 150 to 300 DPI and the dimensions of images range from 1200 by 1600 to 2500 by 3200 pixels.


This folder contains the YACCLAB dataset. The dataset includes both synthetic and real images and is 
suitable for a wide range of applications, ranging from document processing to surveillance, 
and features a significant variability in terms of resolution, image density and number of 
components. All images are provided in 1 bit per pixel PNG format, with 0 (black) being 
background and 1 (white) being foreground.
