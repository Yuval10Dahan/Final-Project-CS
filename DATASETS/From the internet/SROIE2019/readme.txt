Scanned receipts OCR and information extraction (SROIE) + LayoutLM (base)
This dataset was created for the ICDAR 2019 Robust Reading Challenge on Scanned Receipts OCR and Information Extraction (SROIE). The dataset has receipts written in English. It also contains the pre-trained base model LayoutLM, which I use to train the model to extract information from the SROIE dataset.

Content
The dataset contains 973 scanned receipts. For each receipt you have an .jpg file of the scanned receipt, a .txt file holding OCR information and a .txt file holding the key information values.
